        <h3>Poem for a Son:</h3>

        <p>
          <p class="poem">BEFORE you came, my little lad,
            I used to think that I was good,
          Some vicious habits, too, I had,
            But wouldn't change them if I could.
          I held my head up high and said:
            'I'm all that I have need to be,
          It matters not what path I tread,'
            But that was ere you came to me.
          </p>
          <p class="poem">
            I treated lightly sacred things,
            And went my way in search of fun,
            Upon myself I kept no strings,
            And gave no heed to folly done.
            I gave myself up to the fight
            For worldly wealth and earthly fame,
            And sought advantage, wrong or right,
            But that was long before you came.
          </p>
          <p class="poem">
            But now you sit across from me,
            Your big brown eyes are opened wide,
            And every deed I do you see,
            And, O, I dare hot step aside.
            I've shaken loose from habits bad,
            And what is wrong I've come to dread,
            Because I know, my little lad,
            That you will follow where I tread.
          </p>
        </p>
